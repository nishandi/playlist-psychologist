        "pattern": "This is clinical OCD (not a quirk) where music has been absorbed into your compulsion system. The 'I know it's irrational but I cannot stop' is textbook OCD insight - you recognize the illogic but can't override the compulsion. Music is now functioning as anxiety-reduction ritual rather than pleasure source. This requires professional intervention.",
        "actions": "This requires professional help, not music recommendations. OCD responds to Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy, which is the gold standard treatment. Do not attempt self-guided exposure - OCD treatment requires professional guidance to avoid reinforcing compulsions. Resources: International OCD Foundation (iocdf.org) has therapist directories. Your music compulsion is treatable."

Your 'last connection to who I was' is neurologically accurate: music accesses self when other memories fail. Research shows music therapy helps dementia patients maintain identity and stay connected to loved ones.",
        "actions": "Your daughter is doing exactly the right thing. Continue with familiar music from your formative years. Consider recording: while you still can, record yourself talking ABOUT these songs - what they meant, memories attached. Future you might lose words but keep music. This isn't a problem to solve. Music holding you here is beautiful. Resources for your daughter: Alzheimer's Association has music therapy guidance. 'Alive Inside' documentary shows music's power for dementia patients."
